# TTS (Text To Speech)
Different Approaches for Project Text to Speech:
* Approch1 : Joining phonemes to pronunciate a word. 
* Approch2: Working on it(Using filters with a larger database for more natural sound).

## Approch1 
Drawbacks: 
* Database is very small. All English words cannot be pronunciate with this small database.
* Limitaions are there. So, another better approch is required.
